My project is a website in which users can create and answer multiple choice questions. Users can also search for a specific question id and see their rank at the stats page. Admin can delete questions from the answer page. There is a bot in the page that posts a random question every 10 minutes using [this api](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php).
