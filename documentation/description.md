#Documentation  
My project is a website in which after creating an account, users can create, browse and answer multiple choice questions 
and gain score in order to be #1. The project is written with Java using Spring framework. Other languages the project uses:
JavaScript, CSS, HTML and PostgreSQL. The project utilized many Bootstrap components and also nicely rescales to other platforms. Accounts' passwords are protected with BCrypting and the webpage can only be used with https connection.
