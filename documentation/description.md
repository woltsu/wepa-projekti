# Description
My project is a website in which after creating an account, users can create, browse and answer multiple choice questions 
and gain score in order to be #1. The project is written in Java using Spring framework. The website is running in Heroku. Other languages the project uses:  
* JavaScript
* CSS 
* HTML
* PostgreSQL  

The project utilizes many Bootstrap components and also nicely rescales to other platforms. Accounts' passwords are protected with BCrypting and the webpage can only be used with a https connection. The project is linked to Travis which automatically pushes the changes into Heroku if all tests pass.
